## Problem Statement
Given a set of data where outputs are measured on an unknown dynamic system with one input and one output, and the dynamics may be nonlinear while the output may be affected by noise. Two data sets are provided: one to identify the model and another to validate it. The task is to develop a black-box model for the system using a polynomial, nonlinear ARX model and compute one-step-ahead prediction and simulation for the output.

## Approximator Structure
The approximator structure is based on a polynomial, nonlinear ARX model. It involves computing one-step-ahead prediction using a polynomial expansion of the input and output data.

## Finding the Parameters
The parameters for the polynomial expansion are generated by creating a vector corresponding to an element in the sum of the output. All possible combinations of this vector with the sum of elements less than or equal to a specified degree are generated to define the polynomial.

## Key Features
- Automated selection of the best combination of parameters based on the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- Transformation of outputs to Input-output data structures (iddata) for comparison using the compare function to see the Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE).
- The algorithm works for any given data set.

## Tuning Results
The tuning results involve finding the optimal values for the parameters (na, nb, m) based on the lowest MSE. The process is automated and involves iterating through different combinations of parameters to find the best fit.

## Plots for the Optimal Value
Bar plots are generated to visualize the MSE for different combinations of parameters (na, nb) for the optimal value of m.

## Conclusions
The project successfully implements a nonlinear ARX identification algorithm to model the dynamic system using polynomial approximation. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in predicting and simulating the system's output.
